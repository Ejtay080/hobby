        <p>Bear Grylls has always been a huge role model for me when it comes to travel. His love for exploration inspires to go out and explore places. Australia and New  Zealand were incredible. And that was Dad's decision because of Bear Grylls. We say lots of super cool stuff, and even scuba-dived in the Great Barrier Reef. We loved Cairns, Sydney, and Melbourne. </p>

        <p>Keanu Reeves has inspired me to act for a long time. I remember it was my 10th birthday and I watched Matrix for the the first time. He acted so well and gave a incredible solid performance! Which inspired me to into theater.</p>

        <p>Travis Luddon is my best friend, and just a awesome funny dude. He inspires me to be who I am and just have a good time with it. We together coined the imfamous phrase "Goomba". We love chilling together alot and even live literally 400 ft away!</p>

        <p>Chad Smith is just a fantastic drummer. His sense of rhythm and hand movements are impeccible. I've never seen someone like him drum before, and his band the Red Hot Chili Peppers is truly <em>spicy</em> indeed. I love Chad in <em>"Californication"</em>, his drums are so great!</p>
