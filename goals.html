            <h2>Traveling</h2>
            <p>I wish to go to the Mediterranean and also India. I would love to go to somewhere historical and beautiful. I would  like to go the Great Wall someday. These are all goals for me to go traveling more.</p>

            <h2>Theater</h2>
            <p>I wish I could do more theater currently. I haven't done theater in a while since, but I want to start getting back into it more. I can't wait to start learning how to choreograph and have dialogue.</p>
        </br>
        <hr class="new"> 
            <h2>Friends</h2>
            <p>I have kind of grown apart from my friends lately because of school, and how big of a chunk it is out of my time. I want to keep in contact with them as best as I can.</p>
        </br>
        <hr class="new"> 
            <h2>Drumming</h2>
            <p>I love drumming but again, because of school, time is limited towards that sort of thing. Maybe I could figure out a practice time during school days. That would be a great goal for me overall is to organize.</p>
